I am excited to share my latest project, the "IoT Based Smart Portable Attendance System," which leverages cutting-edge technology to streamline and enhance attendance tracking. In this project, I utilized the ESP32 Devkit V1, a versatile microcontroller with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, and the RFID RC522, an RFID reader module that facilitates seamless and contactless attendance marking. Additionally, I integrated a 16x2 I2C LCD Panel to provide a clear and efficient display for real-time information.

The system is designed to be compact and portable, making it ideal for various environments. It features real-time data logging and display of attendance status, ensuring immediate and reliable information. The setup is straightforward, with minimal hardware requirements, and offers scalability for future enhancements such as cloud integration and advanced analytics.

This project aims to revolutionize attendance management systems by making them more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. I am thrilled with the outcome and eager to explore further applications and improvements. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to know more about the project or discuss potential collaborations!
